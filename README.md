A self-driving-car ğŸš— using Feed-Forward algorithm with neural-Network.
-> Pure js ğŸ¥¶
-> no library ğŸ¤¯
-> 2d canvas context is used
-> learns and can follow best car 
-> Collision detection ğŸ’¥
-> basic physics is used for controlling and moving ğŸ“š
-> Basic mathmatics is used for finding the intersection points of sensor lines and other object's edges
-> you'll find more ğŸ¤¡
